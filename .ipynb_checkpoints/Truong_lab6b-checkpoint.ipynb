    "# Lab 6b - Exploring Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome\n",
    "\n",
    "This is it. This is our final lab together and one that is entirely unique in terms of approach and expectations. I'll explain all of that in a moment, but first I wanted to congratulate all of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Well done.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course - _this quarter_ - is a difficult one and all of you have put in the time and effort to get through it. For some of you, python might have clicked immediately; for others, it can take time... _it can still be happening_. But, just like with writing, the more you do it, the better you'll become.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I've stressed repeatedly, rather than memorizing every piece of syntax, make sure you focus on **how** computation works. The core ideas of flow control, iteration, abstraction... functions, classes, and methods. These ideas aren't unique to python and if you can grasp them; then, you're able to work in almost any programming language. **Yes**, there will be hiccups, but if you can _think computationally_ if you can break apart a big problem into the steps that a computer can follow - then you can accomplish amazing things.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which brings us back to this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in your other labs, this lab is much more like a task you'd face at a job. Yes, the outcome is a bit silly, but the *linking together of tools in the cloud through a programming language* is **exactly** the skills you'll be expected to have. What you're learning here really is a skillset that's at the forefront of how geospatial technologies are moving. We're going to be working directly with REST APIs and virtual machines, intergrating our work flow into the computational power available through cloud services.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, that opportunity comes with a cost. Unlike in our other labs, things will break, *they might not go as planned*. In the past, a unique error might pop up (as we are all running complicated systems that leverage lots of different libraries), but fundamentally I knew what the solution _should be_ every time. It was 'canned' in a sense; that's not what's happening here. In this case, you're working with real data and live systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a risk, but if you'd prefer the more 'canned' approach, the other lab remains available.\n"

    "I would recommend you use python 3.7 and that you install jupyter, geopandas, and whatever other visualization or processing libraries you may want (folium, pyplot, altair, etc.). I used the `-c conda-forge` to install everything at once, but do what works for you.\n",

    "Here's where things get tricky. Unlike in other labs, I don't have a set of questions for you to work through. Instead, I'm going to give you an end goal and then some tips on how you might approach it. **Talk with me about your ideas and approaches** - you're going to need advice, and I'm here to give it.\n",

    "\n",
    "What I want you to do is create a map that visualizes how a place is being talked about in the news.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wait, how?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, take a look at [this quickstart guide for sentiment analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/quickstarts/python). You can find another [tutorial here](https://www.pingshiuanchua.com/blog/post/simple-sentiment-analysis-python). That second one uses a few approaches, but I recommend you stick with azure or NLTK. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis gives you a very rough, machine-learning createsd sense of the 'emotion' (positive or negative) in a given set of texts. It's extremely useful, for example, if you are trying to monitor how people are talking about your business(es) online. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then take a look at [this guide on conducting news searches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-news-search/python). (note: you've already set up your environment as they do at the beginning). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read about azure maps' geocoding service [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/search). You have access to this service (see the passkeys below).\n",
    "\n",
    "But, remember, you have other sources of information as well! You could - for example - monitor twitter for tweets about a place (talk to me if you'd like to do this); you could use the geopy geocoder (you've seen examples of this in my code, you can read more about it [here](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/); you could - being careful with your credits - use the Arc GIS API geocoder or other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**At this point, you have a lot of tools open to you**. Talk with your colleagues, talk with me, come up with a plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your final output must have:\n",
    "    1. More than 150 entries.\n",
    "    2. Some indication of the 'sentiment' of the entry (it can be as simple as 'blue for positive, red for negative' push pins; obviously, more interesting results are better)\n",

    "If you're stuck, you can follow along with me as I biuld something during the lab.\n",

    "Here's the workflow I'll follow:\n",
    "1. Conduct a news search about an area (probably Tacoma, but if that doesn't get enough results somewhere else).\n",
    "2. Run the results of that search through the sentiment analysis\n",
    "3. Map it\n",
    "        a. First, just simply putting points on a map with the color related to the sentiment.\n",
    "        b. Then, getting fancier. I'll try to create a heat map and then even normalize that heat map based on sentiment or population or something. Who knows where we'll end up, it's exciting to poke at code.\n",
